 Product Description:
 An assignment that shows the building of an architecture which is to be called the HYPO Simulater –
 Also known as the hypothetical decimal machine. It is a machine that simulates by the use of functions
 or also known as methods to compute and to execute, it also a two address machine. In lieu to that, it is a program that essentially 
 simulates a computer. The machine demonstrates that all existing computing systems are binary. It has
 local variables that will represent the hardware and simulate the functions that the program will run.
