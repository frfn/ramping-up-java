# Learning Classes

### Access Modifiers for variables

- **`Private`**: can only be used in the current class, and not outside the class
- **`Protected`**: can be used in the current class and subclasses of the class
- **`Public`**: all classes can refer to this field, this is default

### `Inheritance` VS `Composition`

`Is-A` relationship is **`inheritance`**

Inheritance is important because it promotes code reuse, it also allows us to use another class as base which makes it easy to create other objects or apps!

> when the class either has an implements or extends, it most likely is an IS-A relationship

- bus `IS-A` vehicle
- car `IS-A` vehicle
- potato `IS-A` vegetable

---

`Has-A` relationship is **`composition`** <br>

**`Composition`** allows the reuse of the code, since Java doesn't support **multiple inheritance**, we can achieve it.

> current class has a reference to an instance of another class, basically, the object will use another object ( same object or a different object )

- car `HAS-A` engine
- bike `HAS-A` engine
- dog `HAS-A` tail

# Encapsulation

- the idea of making things that are sensitive **hidden**. An example is declaring variables **`private`**

- `private String name;`
  - you can only access the `name` variable in the class it is in, you can create setters and getters to interact with it!

# Data Abstraction

It is the process of **restricting** and only showing important information to the user. Methods shall be filled in the subclasses that `extends` | `implements` the `abstract class` | `interface`

### `abstract` class and methods

When we talk about abstract classes we are defining characteristics of an object type; specifying what an object is.

- cannot be instantiated, must be inherited
- methods that are abstract shall be filled by the subclass
- variables may contain non-final variables

### `interface`

When we talk about an interface and define capabilities that we promise to provide, we are talking about establishing a contract about what the object can do.

- complete abstraction
- it's a way to give behaviors to the class
- giveLight() from an interface can be used in lamp objects, etc.
- variables in an interface is final, public, and static

# Polymorphism

- many forms, it happens when objects are related with each other through inheritance

```
 Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object
 Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
 Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object
 
 You can probably put the values in a list that's a type of Animal
```

# Final 

- **`non-access modifier`**, simplified means you can't change it, you can't access it and you can't override it
  
    - prevents method overloading
    - prevents variable modification
    - prevents inheritance

# HashMap

A hash map is a **collection** of items, mostly known for its constant time, and key/pair value design!

```
HashMap<Integer, Car> = new HashMap<Integer, Car>();
```
- `.get()` to access an item
- `.remove()` to remove an item
- `.clear()` to remove all items

[All the functions of HashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)

To print out **`keys`** in the HashMap
```
// Print keys
for (String i : capitalCities.keySet()) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

To print out **`values`** in the HashMap
```
// Print values
for (String i : capitalCities.values()) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

To print out both
```
// Print keys and values
for (String i : capitalCities.keySet()) {
  System.out.println("key: " + i + " value: " + capitalCities.get(i));
}
```

# StringBuilder

Create a mutable string!
```
StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
```
- `.append(string)`
- `.insert(index, string)`
- `.reverse()`
- `.charAt()`
- `.substring(beginningIndex, endIndex)`
