# Polymorphism

To have many forms. It is the idea of objects having different implementation and structure, yet being the same. 

Example can be the flying machines, jet, helicopter, yet they're different but at its core, the same. 

With polymorphism you can interact with these objects as if it was the same object.

# Overiew

- Polymorphism
- Interface
- Inheritance

# Demo

- created a class called FlyingMachine that implements CanFly

- created Jet and Helicopter that extends FlyingMachine

- Now in the main, polymorphism is shown through the collection of which the objects are in. To go even further, we interacted with all these different objects, as one! They all share a function!

- Enforces the '_they're all implemented differently, but they're all the same!_'
