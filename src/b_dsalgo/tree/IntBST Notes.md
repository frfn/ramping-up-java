# IntBST ( Binary Search Tree )

A `binary search tree` is a data structure that is a binary tree but has a characteristic that makes it different from any other tree.
From the root node, the left value is smaller compared to the root value, and the right value is greater than the root value. 

# TreeNode

A very simple node class for the tree structure.
- data is `int`
- has 'parent', `left` and `right` TreeNode references
